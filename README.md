# Flipkart-Clone-MERN
This project is a replica of the popular e-commerce platform Flipkart, built using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack. It aims to mimic the core functionalities of Flipkart, including user authentication, product listing, shopping cart management, order processing, and more.

# Status
This project is currently under construction. I am actively working on implementing the various features and functionalities to achieve a fully functional replica of Flipkart.
